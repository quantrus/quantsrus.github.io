                <section id="post-body">
                    <p>I recently stumbled upon a blog which suggested to <a href="http://chasethedevil.github.io/post/dont-stay-flat-with-andreasen-huge-interpolation/">not stay flat with Andreasen-Huge</a> arbitrage free volatility interpolation method. The paper from Andreasen and Huge specifies a piecewise constant (single-step) local volatility where the number of constants matches the number of market option prices.</p>

<p>The blog post shows eventual unstability with the piecewise constant approach, not visible with a linear interpolation. I wondered then if we should not go to the next level: use a spline on N values where N is the number of market options prices. Using a spline to represent the local volatility is a very common idea, for example it is in the large-step local volatility method of <a href="https://ssrn.com/abstract=2008215">Reghai-Boya-Vong</a>.</p>

<p>I tried this idea on SPX500 options of maturity 1 year and stumbled upon erratic behavior depending on the number of nodes used in the grid. In reality, this was due to using the wrong monotone interpolation. I had used Hyman-Dougherty monotone interpolation by habit. But the data is far from being monotone, and the Hyman interpolation does not necessarily behave well on non-monotone data: by design, it can still wiggle over or under the nodes. This is what happens on the figure below, which zooms problematic region of the local variance: it becomes negative with Hyman interpolation.

        <h4>Local variance as a function of the log-strike. Zoom on the problematic region with Hyman interpolation.</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>
</p>

<p>A real monotone interpolation, without the problems of the discontinuity introduced by the Hyman approach as evidenced in the paper <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2175002">Stable Interpolation for the Yield Curve</a>, but not well-known, is the <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19910011517.pdf">rational limiter of Huynh</a>. It is also possible to simply use the non-negative interpolation of Hyman-Dougherty (denoted as Hyman-NG in the figure), but in theory, this will introduce a discontinuity, which could be problematic in the optimization routine.</p>

<p>It works well with a properly monotone spline, but how does the one-step local volatility looks like?

<figure >
    
        <img src="/post/andreasen_huge_spline_good.png" />
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>Local variance as a function of the log-strike with Huynh rational limiter.</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>
</p>

<p>With so many wiggles in the local volatility, it is not obvious this is really preferable to a linear interpolation.</p>
